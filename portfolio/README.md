# Christelle Sikuli - Responsive Personal Portfolio

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, created as part of my coursework at Uganda Christian University. The site is designed to be modern, clean, and fully responsive, showcasing my profile, skills, projects, and contact information.

## Design Choices

- **Colors & Typography:**  
  I selected a soft blue gradient background for a calm, professional look. The "Poppins" font is used throughout for readability and a modern feel. Accent colors are based on a custom Bootstrap primary color to keep the design consistent.

- **Layout:**  
  The site uses Bootstrap 5’s grid system for responsive layouts and custom CSS Flexbox for sections like the hero and footer. Cards are used for projects and interests, providing a clean and organized presentation.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  All pages are fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. I used Bootstrap’s grid and spacing utilities, along with custom media queries, to ensure the site looks good on any device.

- **Navigation:**  
  The navbar uses Bootstrap’s responsive collapse feature, making navigation easy on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Components:**  
  - **Cards:** Used for projects and fun facts/interests, with subtle hover and fade-in animations for interactivity.
  - **Buttons:** Styled with Bootstrap and custom hover effects for a modern touch.
  - **Forms:** The contact page includes a Bootstrap-styled form for easy communication.
  - **Scroll-to-top button:** Added for user convenience and improved usability.

- **Accessibility:**  
  All images have descriptive alt text, and buttons/links have clear labels for better accessibility.
